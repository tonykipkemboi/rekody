<p align="center"><strong>/tʃɑːm.ɡeɪ/</strong> — a Kalenjin greeting meaning "How are you?"</p>

> Kalenjin is a community from the highlands of Kenya. *Chamgei* is how you say hello — a word that opens conversation. We chose it because that's what this tool does: opens the conversation between your voice and your computer.

**Open-source, privacy-first voice dictation for the terminal.**

Hold `⌥Space`, speak, release. Your words appear at the cursor — anywhere on your desktop.

### Hotkey

| Mode | Shortcut | Behaviour |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Push-to-talk** (default) | `⌥Space` | Hold to record, release to transcribe |
| **Toggle** | `⌥Space` | Tap to start, tap again to stop |

> **macOS:** chamgei uses an active `CGEventTap` so `⌥Space` is fully suppressed — it will not insert a non-breaking space into your focused window. Requires **Accessibility** permission (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility).

### Configuration

```bash
chamgei config          # show current config
chamgei config edit     # open config.toml in $EDITOR
chamgei config path     # print config file location
```

Config file lives at `~/.config/chamgei/config.toml`.

**All options:**

```toml
activation_mode = "push_to_talk"   # "push_to_talk" | "toggle"
injection_method = "clipboard"     # "clipboard" | "native"
vad_threshold = 0.01               # RMS energy threshold (0.005–0.05)
whisper_model = "tiny"             # "tiny" | "small" | "medium" | "large"

# STT engine
stt_engine = "deepgram"            # "local" | "deepgram" | "groq" | "cohere"
deepgram_api_key = "dg_..."        # required when stt_engine = "deepgram"

# LLM post-processing (omit or set false to disable)
# Auto-disabled when stt_engine = "deepgram" (smart_format handles cleanup)
llm_enabled = false                # true | false | omit for auto

# LLM providers — tried in order, first success wins
[[providers]]
name = "groq"
api_key = "gsk_..."
model = "openai/gpt-oss-20b"

[[providers]]
name = "ollama"            # local fallback, no key needed
model = "llama3.2:3b"
```

### API Keys

Keys are stored in the macOS Keychain — never in plaintext on disk.

```bash
chamgei key set deepgram     # securely prompt + save
chamgei key set groq
chamgei key list             # show which keys are stored
chamgei key delete groq      # remove a key
```

### History

```bash
chamgei history                    # last 20 dictations
chamgei history -c 50              # last 50
chamgei history -s "bug fix"       # search by text
chamgei history -a "VS Code"       # filter by app
chamgei history --full             # show full text + raw transcript
chamgei history --stats            # usage statistics + top apps
chamgei history --json             # raw JSON output (pipe-friendly)
chamgei history --copy 1           # copy latest entry to clipboard
chamgei history --copy 3           # copy 3rd-most-recent to clipboard
```

History is stored at `~/.config/chamgei/history.json` (up to 5,000 entries).

### Doctor

```bash
chamgei doctor    # live connectivity check for all configured providers
```

## STT Engines

| Engine | Quality | Latency | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| `deepgram` | ★★★★★ | ~200ms | Nova-3, smart formatting, cloud |
| `groq` | ★★★★☆ | ~300ms | Whisper Large v3, cloud |
| `local` | ★★★☆☆ | varies | On-device whisper.cpp, Metal GPU, offline |
| `cohere` | ★★★★☆ | varies | Local server on configurable port |

**Recommended:** `deepgram` — fastest, most accurate, already produces clean punctuated output (no LLM needed on top).

---

## LLM Providers

LLM post-processing cleans filler words, fixes grammar, and adapts formatting to the active app (code editor, chat, email, etc.). **Automatically disabled when using Deepgram** since it already formats output.

| Provider | Type | Default model |
|----------|------|---------------|
| `groq` | Cloud | `openai/gpt-oss-20b` |
| `cerebras` | Cloud | `llama3.1-8b` |
| `together` | Cloud | `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo` |
| `openrouter` | Cloud | `llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free` |
| `fireworks` | Cloud | user's choice |
| `openai` | Cloud | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `anthropic` | Cloud | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` |
| `gemini` | Cloud | `gemini-2.0-flash` |
| `ollama` | Local | `llama3.2:3b` |
| `lm-studio` | Local | loaded model |
| `vllm` | Local | user's choice |
| `custom` | Any | user's choice |

Multiple providers fall back automatically: first success wins.

## Security

- **Audio never leaves your machine** unless you choose a cloud STT engine.
- **LLM calls send only the transcript text** — never raw audio.
- **API keys stored in system keychain** (macOS Keychain) — not in config files or env vars.
- **Config file chmod 0600** — readable only by the owning user.
- **History file chmod 0600** — same protection.
- **Active event tap** suppresses `⌥Space` before it reaches other apps.
- **No telemetry, no analytics, no phone-home.**

## For AI Agents

Chamgei is designed to be easy for AI coding agents to install and configure:

```bash
# Point your agent at this file, then:
# "Install chamgei and set it up with Deepgram"

# Quick machine-readable status
chamgei doctor --json 2>/dev/null || chamgei --version

# Non-interactive config update
chamgei config path           # get config file path
# then edit ~/.config/chamgei/config.toml directly

# Set a key non-interactively (via security CLI)
security add-generic-password -s "com.chamgei.voice" -a "deepgram" -w "YOUR_KEY" -U

# Get history as JSON for downstream processing
chamgei history --json -c 100

# Copy last transcript to clipboard
chamgei history --copy 1
```

**SKILLS.md** contains a structured agent onboarding guide — point your agent at it:

> "Read SKILLS.md and set up chamgei for voice dictation on this machine."
